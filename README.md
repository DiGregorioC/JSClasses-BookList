# Javascript Local booklist #

A simple front-end only booklist made in Javascript, to practice using ES6 Classes.

## What I got gained from this: ##
- Continued practice with javascript and DOM manipulation and traversal
- Continued practice with JS classes
- Experience working with skelton CSS

## Future Ideas: ##
- Create a backend for storage
- Implement local storage on cookies
